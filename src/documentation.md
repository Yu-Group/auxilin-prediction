## quickstart
- set the correct paths in `config.py`
- download cached data after tracking from [this gdrive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mh2wn0KLtj90j_rfgPUGEJgMZAEl0Yi7?usp=sharing) - should be added to the folder `data/tracks`
- run `python data.py` to properly preprocess all the data (will cache it into the "processed folder")

## docs
- [docs]() generated by running `pdoc --html . --output-dir docs` from the `src` folder

## acknowledgements
- this is a collaboration between the Berkeley [Yu-Group](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~yugroup/) and the [Berkeley Advanced Bioimaging Center](http://abc.berkeley.edu/)
- uses code from several wonderful packages including [cmeAnalysis](https://github.com/DanuserLab/cmeAnalysis) (DanuserLab) and sklearn
