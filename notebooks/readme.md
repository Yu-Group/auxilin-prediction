#### TP/FP videos

## kymographs

# 00_eda_tracks


## look at tracks themselves

## visualize a single example

## basic eda

## look at displacement features

## look at learned dictionaries

## viz tracks where auxilin peaks first

## visualize splines

## feats centered around peak
**gets the clathrin traces aligned by their maximum, padded by zeros when necessary**

## pairplot of most relevant feats

## spike-times plot

## spike magnitude plot

###### Random projections

# 01_reg_amplitude

## unsure tracks

## visualize outcomes
- take mean, take sigma, define events with a threshold

## viz curves

**compare as a func of aux_max**

## look at hotspots

## compare different outcome defs
